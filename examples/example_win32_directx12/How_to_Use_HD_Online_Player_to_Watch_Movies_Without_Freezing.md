Deep Freeze is a software that restores your computer to its original state every time you reboot it. This means that any changes you make to your system, such as installing new programs, deleting files, or changing settings, will be erased when you restart your computer. Deep Freeze is useful for preventing malware infections, system errors, or unwanted modifications by other users. However, it can also interfere with your online streaming experience, as it might prevent HD Online Player from running properly or saving your preferences.
 
To use HD Online Player without any problems caused by Deep Freeze, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download HD Online Player from [https://hd-online-player.com](https://hd-online-player.com) and install it on your computer.

3. Before you start watching the movie, click on the Settings icon in the top right corner of the HD Online Player window.

Note that the Anti Deep Freeze feature only works while HD Online Player is running. Once you close HD Online Player or restart your computer, the temporary folder will be deleted and your system will be restored to its original state by Deep Freeze. If you want to use HD Online Player again, you need to repeat the steps above every time.
